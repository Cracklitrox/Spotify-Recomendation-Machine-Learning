The present project carried out in Kedro belongs to the first evaluation of the subject 'Machine Learning', the steps to follow for its installation and later use will be indicated below:

1) Download the repository in a path of the user's choice.
2) Execute this code to install the virtual environment 'pip install virtualenv'.
3) Followed by this with user's choice 'python3 -m venv environment_name'.
2) From the main path ('Machine Learning Evaluation 1') execute this code to activate the virtual environment '.venv/Script/activate'.
3) Once installed, open the folder from Visual Studio Code and go to the path 'machine-learning' through this code 'cd machine-learning'.
4) To install the project dependencies, execute this code 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
5) Then to activate the nodes (Incomplete) run this code 'Kedro run'.

To start the Notebooks, the instructions are slightly different:

1) From an external terminal of Visual Studio Code, go to the 'machine-learning' path through a code similar to this (It changes depending on the project path and the user) 'cd C:\Users user's path to Machine Learning Evaluation 1\machine-learning'.
2) Then run this code 'jupyter notebook'.
